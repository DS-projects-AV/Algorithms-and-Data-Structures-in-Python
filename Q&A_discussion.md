Questions for Professor :

1. How does the negative indexing in arrays / tuples / lists work ?

2. Stack can be called as both FILO and LIFO

How does this work ?

3. Stacks acan be implemented either using arrays or Linked lists. In case of arrays, when element is inserted/deleted ( pushed/popped), it is done at the end of the array. Whereas in case of linked list, element inserted/deleted is at the beginning of the linked list
