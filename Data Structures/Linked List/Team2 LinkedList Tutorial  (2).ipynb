    "\n",
    "    This tutorial taught us to use Markdown in Jupyter notebooks. Apart from this, the implementation part taught us how to practically implement the given data structure in python and document the key differences. The template was useful as it laid down the basic structure we can follow, for explaining any data structure.\n",

    "2. What is the most difficulty part of doing this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most difficult part of doing this project was to implement linked lists and its various types. Apart from this, defining the operations we want to support and understanding implementation of those operations ensuring their theoretical time complexities was also challenging. For instance, implementing deletion at head is possible in both linear and O(1) step but ensuring the implementation matched the theoretically prescribed algorithm was good task for 4 different types of linked lists. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How did you overcome the difficulty and accomplish this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "    In order to overcome this, we took help of google search and some well-known educational sites like geekforgeeks.com and stackoverflow.com specially for the implementation part. Then we thoroughly proof read and verified with test cases that the implementation was correct. We also looked at some other tutorials to understand what would make good content flow.\n",

    "    If given a chance to start again , then we would firstly understand the scope and set clear expectations of the tutorial before jumping to the implementation part. For instance, in our data structure that is linked list, we tried to accomodate the codes for all 4 types of linked lists like singly, doubly, circular singly and circular doubly. We would like to know if that much details were required or it over-complicated the entire tutorial. \n",
